#
# Prerequisites:
#	- Lync 2013: Requires SEFAUtil installed on the system and SQL Dynamic Ports opened in Windows Firewall on all Front End servers.
#	- Skype for Business (CU1+): Requires SQL Dynamic Ports opened in Windows Firewall on all Front End servers.
#	- The SQL ports on Front End servers firewall can be opened automatically with the OpenSQLPortsForCallPickupManager1.00.ps1 supplied with this tool.
#	- Get more information here: http://www.myskypelab.com/2013/10/lync-2013-call-pickup-group-manager.html
#	
#
# Release Notes:
# 1.00 Initial Release.
#
# 1.01 Feature update
#		- Pre-Req check will now look under the default reskit location on all available drives (not just C:)
#		- If SEFAUTIL gives no response (due to an unknown error in SEFAUTIL) the tool will display an error to the user.
#		- Added the Import-Module Lync command in case you run the script from regular Powershell or use the Right Click Run using Powershell method to start the script.
#
# 1.02 Maintenance Update
#		- Added the undocumented "/verbose" flag to the SEFAUtil calls to help with debugging SEFAUtil issues. See post: http://www.myskypelab.com/2014/04/sefautil-and-lync-2013-call-pickup.html
#
# 1.03 Common Area Phone Update
#		- This version has been updated to handle Common Area Phones. Some people reported errors being displayed by the tool when they had manually set (with SEFAUTIL) Group Call Pickup against Common Area Phones (ie. against the SIP URI of the Common Area Device, eg: sip:fbcb642b-f5bc-477a-a053-373aef4c00f8@domain.com). As of this version Common Area Phones will be included in the user list, and you can add and remove them from Call Pickup Groups.
#		- User listboxes are now slightly wider to deal with the long SIP addresses of Common Area Phones.
#		- When the tool loads it will display in the PowerShell window the SIP Address and Display Name of all common area devices so you can match the (GUID looking) SIP address in the tool to the display name of the device.
#
# 1.04 Scalability Update
#		- Now supports window resizing.
#		- Added Filter on Lync users listbox to cater for deployments that have lots of users.
#		- Script is now signed.
#	
# 1.05 Enhancements
#		- Now checks that Group number matches a range that exists in one of the Call Pickup Orbits before allowing it to be added to the group list.
#		- Up and Down keys in Orbit listbox now update orbit details properly.
#		- You can now specify an alternate location of SEFAUTIL.exe in the command line. (Example: .\Lync2013CallPickupManager.1.05 "D:\folder\SEFAUTIL.exe")
#		- Now checks the Skype for Business RESKIT location.
#		- Put a dividing line between the Orbit creation section and the Group configuration section to try and indicate a divide between the two areas.
#		- The Group list box label now displays the group name being listed up so the user understands better what group the user list is associated with.
#
# 2.00 Major Update
#		- When using Skype for Business the new Call Pickup Group Powershell commands (Available in CU1+) for user settings are detected and used instead of SEFAUTIL. This means you don't have to worry about any SEFAUTIL configuration anymore in Skype for Business CU1 or higher!
#		- Unfortunately the Skype for Business Powershell commands have proved to be too slow for the discovery of all users Call Pickup Settings (because "Get-CsUser | Get-CsGroupPickupUserOrbit" has to iterate through all users taking about 2+ seconds per user and as a result takes ages for large sites). So I have retained and made major improvements to the direct SQL discovery method from version 1.0 for both Lync 2013 and Skype for Business.
#		- Changed the way the Groups list box works. It now will be automatically filled with all the available groups from the Orbit ranges assigned in the system. If there is a user in a Group then it will be highlighted in Green text with Yellow background to help you find users without looking in empty groups.
#		- When Orbits are added all the available groups (eg. from Range Start to Range End) will automatically be added to the available Groups list. Note: when you remove ranges that contain groups with users in them the group will no longer be accessible in the interface, however, the Pickup Group will still function. So make sure you remove users from groups before you delete the Orbit range.
#		- Added a refresh button so the data can now be updated from the system whenever you want.
#		- Improved the speed of looking through groups by re-architecting the group coding.
#		- After a user is added or removed from a group the tool does not rescan all user's data again. Whilst fully rescanning always ensures the data being displayed is up to date, it's also much slower. This version is optimised for speed :)
#		- Added pretty looking UP and DOWN arrow icons on add and remove buttons to try and clarify operation.
#		- Added the "Find Selected User" button to find which group a user is assigned to.
#		- Added help tool tips on buttons.
#
# 2.01 Enhancements
#		- Added an export to CSV data to the app.
#		- Fixed an issue with highlighting groups with users in them.
#
# 2.02 Enhancements
#		- Updated for Skype for Business 2019
